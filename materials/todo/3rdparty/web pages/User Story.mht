getting a view of a <A =

that's more involved than what's been presented on this page so far. =
<STRONG>A=20
<A href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UserStory">UserStory</A> is also a =
work unit and=20
an estimation unit. In this it's actually considerably heavier - not =

A <A=20

each of which must be properly regression tested and refactored to make =

<A=20
href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CommitmentSchedule">CommitmentSchedule</A>=
, we ask=20
the users to split a story if we estimate it at more than about 3 weeks, =
on the=20
grounds that we don't understand it. We combine stories willy-nilly if =
they=20
don't add up to at least a week, for estimation only. (That is, we don't =

<P></P><STRONG>From <A=20

the role of a story as a work unit comes considerably after the role of =

unit).=20
<P></P>I was trying to use your words. I'll try again. The story is used =
by the=20
customer to make informed decisions about the scope of the next release, =

decisions informed by the estimated cost of the story and the velocity =

maybe I'm going off the deep end, but that's how it seems to me.=20
<P></P>I should say that I'm in a bizarre methodological context at the =

trying to relate XP concepts to RUP and MSF concepts without doing =

That is a very interesting set of observations, Peter. I am willing to =
make the=20
assertion that that "considerable process baggage" you are seeing =

set of practices <A=20
href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation">Chrysle=

the term=20
User Story, nor even to XP proper. I figure that by wording my assertion =
this=20
way, Kent will find the right place to disagree with me.=20
<P></P>I go back to Kent's original line, up above, "Tell me the stories =
of what=20
the system will do. Write down the name of the story and a paragraph or =
two."=20
Its intent is to capture some information, specifically not tying the =
user down=20
to matters of, "Can it be implemented in 3 weeks?", "Is it normalized in =
terms=20
of the simplest definition of what is needed?", or "Does it have =
engineering=20
tasks and a regression test?" Those latter things are ways the team =
looks at and=20
uses the <A href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UserStory">UserStory</A> to =
work out=20
their plan.=20

href=3D"http://members.aol.com/acockburn/papers/usecases.htm">http://memb=
ers.aol.com/acockburn/papers/usecases.htm</A>=20
that one can characterize the many uses of <A=20
href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UseCases">UseCases</A> according to 4 =
questions:=20
<P></P>
<OL>
  <LI><EM>Purpose</EM>: Is the purpose of use cases to gather user =
stories, or=20
  build real requirements? (the values are stories, or requirements). To =
answer=20
  "requirements" implies that consistency, completeness, non-overlap, =
non=20
  contradiction are major tests of the result. I don't get that these =
are=20
  mandatory elements of User Story. To answer "stories" implies that the =
purpose=20
  of the exercise is to get a view of the world from the user's =
standpoint,=20
  warts, wiggles, and all. In the case of <A=20
  href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UserStory">UserStory</A>, the answer is =

  "stories".=20
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Contents</EM>: Are the contents of the use case required to be =

  consistent, or can they be self-contradicting? If consistent, are they =
in=20
  plain prose or are they in a formal notation (the values are =
contradicting,=20
  consistent prose, formal content). My guess is that two user stories =
would be=20
  allowed to contradict each other, if the users disagreed during their=20
  interviews. I would further guess that Kent or Ron would chase those =
users=20
  around until they came up with clarifications to their stories that =
made them=20
  non-contradicting. So possible values are "contradicting" and =
"consistent=20
  prose."=20
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Plurality</EM>: Is a use case really just another name for a =
scenario,=20
  or does a use case contain more than one use case? (the values are 1 =
or=20
  multiple). Answer is 1. <A=20
  href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UserStory">UserStory</A> does not =
distinguish=20
  multiple scenarios the way Jacobson's or my use cases do.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Structure</EM>: Does a collection of use cases have a formal=20
  structure, an informal structure, or do they form an unstructured =
collection=20
  (the values are unstructured, semi-formal, formal structure). Answer =
is=20
  "unstructured". At the end, there is a heap of index cards.=20
  <P></P></LI></OL>All of which gets me back to the assertion that how =
C3 chose to=20
manage the User Stories is separate from "What is a User Story?". How =
did I do?=20

Alistair- I find myself at odds with your description at what I think is =

pretty deep philosophical level. The ghost of Descartes runs through =
every point=20
you make above. I blessed and released that fine gentleman some time =

more specific:=20
<P></P>
<OL>
  <LI>Purpose. The purpose is different at different times. First it is =
to get=20
  the user to tell me what the system has to do first, and what it =
doesn't need=20
  to do at the moment. "the purpose of the exercise is to get a view of =
the=20

particular view=20
  of the world from the user's standpoint that I can somehow participate =
in if I=20
  just sacrifice a chicken the right way. The user is learning. I am =
learning.=20
  We are learning together. So to say, "...get a view..." is the wrong =
metaphor.=20
  I'm not sure what the right metaphor is, but I'll think about it.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Content- "formal notation" doesn't imply "consistent". Every =
program I've=20
  ever written demonstrates that. There is certainly an interesting =
question to=20
  ask about the intersection of notational style, expressiveness, and =
politics=20
  (sometimes I see software engineers using formality to maintain =
control).=20
  <P></P>

as=20
  asking if the user needs one or more than one acceptance test to be =
confident=20
  that the story is done?=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Structure- "At the end..." There is no "end". This point seems to =
be=20
  assuming that requirements gathering is a phase, at the end of which =
you have=20
  some artifact that allows you to do something else in the next phase.=20

Thanks, Kent. After hearing your gardening analogy, I understand more of =
what=20
you are saying. Being aware that it was you, and not I, who introduced =
the idea=20

<P></P>I'm working with my development team to come up with an Agile =
Development=20
methodology that works for our group. Right now, I'm brainstorming with =
our UI=20
expert on how to integrate a coherent UI design into the process. =
Another aspect=20
of our particular set of needs (which I suspect is very common) is that =
the user=20
writing the story represents business needs, but might not dovetail =
exactly with=20
the wants and needs of the actual users (the users are third party =
clients). For=20
this reason, we're looking at some up front UI design and some research =
with the=20
actual users to determine how well the stories fit with what they do.=20
<P></P>Anyway, one suggestion our UI designer came up with is adding =
another=20
aspect to our stories. We're looking at adding a "why?" to each story =
card. It=20
seems to me that this is a great idea and the benefits are threefold. =
First, in=20
the case of a publicly facing page, our UI designer has some background =
to=20
possibly suggest modifications of our stories to better resolve the =
needs of our=20
clients with our business needs. Second, in all cases it allows both the =
UI=20
designer and the developers to suggest modified stories which might =
better fit=20
the "why?" aspect of the story. Third, it aids in prioritization of (and =

possibly even elimination of) stories. Has anyone tried anything like =
this? Does=20
it work?=20

<P></P>About <EM>I'm working with my development team to come up with an =
Agile=20
Development methodology that works for our group. Right now, I'm =
brainstorming=20
with our UI expert on how to integrate a coherent UI design into the=20
process.</EM>: I am interested in your work. Who are you? What are your =
results=20
so far?=20
<P></P>I've created a new page called <A=20
href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UsabilityAndAgileMethodologies">UsabilityA=
ndAgileMethodologies</A>=20
to go into a bit more detail. -- <A=20

<P></P>
<HR>
This user story doesn't specify anything about HOW to implement what is =
needed,=20
but is very specific about what is needed. -- <A=20
href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DonaldMcLean">DonaldMcLean</A>=20
<P></P>In the event log example we usually have very specific =
requirements that=20
must be met. Just saying we need an event log isn't terribly useful. We =
need to=20
know things like what is the mutex behaviour, is it ISR safe, what is =
the max=20
amount of memory that can be used, what's the on disk limit, etc. Is =
each of=20
these a separate story or part of the same story?=20
<HR>

<P></P>That's an interesting paradigm, it's a practical method to =
developing.=20
But my questions are about the maintenance of that system when the team =
work has=20
been dissolved. I mean, are the <A=20
href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UserStories">UserStories</A> enough to =
understand=20
the code, and the programming philosophy?; could other work team take =
the=20
administration or maintenance of that system? HOW? -- <A=20

<P></P>
<HR>

<P></P>What happened to user stories? They seem to be morphing into =
requirements=20
and use cases. I read now where they have turn into an acceptance test =
which=20
really requires an immense amount of detail. For example, i can't just =
have a=20
short story like "user can select shipping options" and then talk about =
what=20
that means later. For a test to be generated this would have to be fully =

designed into a form that is much larger than any index card and would =
be more=20
complete than the heaviest use case.=20
<HR>
I thought I had this all figured out; now you all have me confused.=20
<P></P>I've been using <A=20
href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UserStories">UserStories</A> as concrete =
examples=20
of <A href=3D"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UseCases">UseCases</A> being =
invoked. Most of=20
the requirements negotiation tends to fall not in the general =
characteristics of=20
a use case but in the detail revealed in a user story (The who, what, =
why of a=20
use case usually is pretty much determined by the business process).=20
<P></P>What I find disturbing in this discussion is the suggestion that =
there is=20
some deep gulf between them. I learned a long time ago that the most =
useful use=20
case is:=20
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI>a unit of interaction; you can imagine the user coming up to the =
machine,=20
  invoking a use case, and walking away happy.=20
  <LI>a unit of work; it can be delivered in one iteration and =
cost-estimated=20
  with some confidence.=20
  <LI>a unit of test.=20
  <LI>a unit of documentation.=20
  <LI>one section in the user guide.=20
  <LI>one help frame.=20
  <P></P></LI></UL>This sounds pretty close to the specs for a user =
story. -- <A=20

<P></P>As a matter of fact, user stories are something that I cannot =
really=20
describe how they made my life easier. Here is what I did. My company is =
PMI=20
standards oriented, so they still believe in plans, schedules and dead =
lines.=20
And in order to get the contract, I had to submit a full detailed plan. =
This=20
cannot happen, this is why XP is for. Not to give deadlines that you =
really=20
don't know about well, in the plans I used to give about 2-3 weeks of an =
item=20
called "User Stories and Interface" it was a good sell for them (both my =
CEO and=20
the Customer). What I did is that I used to meet with the customer, and =
I did=20
write the user stories. And I changed the Metaphor concept a bit for =
each user=20
story I had a page as a prototype and when user stories are complete =
into a=20
scene I rushed back to the customer to get their feedback on the =
prototype and=20
from the user stories I had tasks. I am a project manager, and I am not =
away=20
from the code, so I meet with the developers, and we estimate on the =
user=20
stories, and I make sure to down size the tasks to a day for each now I =
have a=20
plan according to the PMI standards and in fact I am doing the iteration =

according to the XP and I have a milestone (a release) and I had the =
developers=20
estimate and each developer can come to my office to get his/her user =
story, and=20
with the user story there is an attached document representing the page =
from the=20
prototype. All what I know is the pile of user stories is vanishing in =
the speed=20
of light. I really love XP and I really owe a big thank you for the =
great people=20
who made my life happy - the people who invented this XP.=20
<P></P>Thank you all=20
